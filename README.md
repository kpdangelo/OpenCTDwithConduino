Follow the basic assembly instructions from OpenCTD along with the included instructions for constructing
a Conduino.

PCBs can be ordered from OSHPARK, or Eagle and Gerber files are included here.

The system goes into a 2" PVC pipe and details of that will be coming soon after I edit the end-cap, but the gist of it can be found at the Open CTD site.
